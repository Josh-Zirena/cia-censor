engineered by Josh Zirena hosted on Heroku.

== Instructions ==
1. This application will censor out a given word(s). 
2. You may use the existing text or upload your own text file.

Please note: I am using the free version of Heroku so a refresh may be necessary if you encounter any errors. (They are usually Heroku errors.)
